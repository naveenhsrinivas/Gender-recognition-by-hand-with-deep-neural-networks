# Gender-recognition-by-hand-with-deep-neural-networks
Gender is the primary parameter in the identification of a user.
Its uses are with the introduction of Convolutional Neural Networks in computer vision,
Image analysis has found deeper dimensions. 
CNN combined with Image processing can achieve prediction of Gender from the image of a subject. 
In the following project, Features are extracted from a labeled hands image dataset, 
later these features called feature map are used as an input to a neural network to classify Gender.
